# SAP Training Repository

Welcome to my SAP Training repository! This repository contains Python exercises and learning materials from my SAP training class at **KPRIT College** conducted on **October 7, 2025**.

## 📚 Contents

### Notebooks
- **`7-10-25.ipynb`** - Python programming exercises covering:
  - Function definitions and usage
  - String manipulation and input handling
  - Tuple operations
  - Mathematical calculations (square function)

## 🐍 Python Exercises Covered

### 1. User Information Functions
- `print_name()` - Creates a welcome tuple with user's name
- `name()` - Gets user input for name and displays welcome message
- `hello()` - Handles user roll number input and creates formatted output

### 2. Mathematical Functions
- `find_square()` - Calculates and returns the square of a number

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Python extension

### Running the Code
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivaganesht/SAP-Training.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
